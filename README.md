### Scientific & Technical Writer | PhD in Physics

I’m a scientific and technical writer with a **background** in **Physics (PhD)** and **Chemistry (Bachelor and Master's degrees)** and hands-on experience with **coding and science communication**. I like to work at the intersection of **technology, research, and documentation** and also enjoy creating science- and tech-related content for general audiences. I focus on turning complex topics into clear, usable, and well-structured material.

This GitHub profile serves as a **portfolio hub** and contains:
- 📘 Technical writing samples
- 📄 Academic / scientific writing
- 🐍 Small Python projects
- 🌐 Links to my longer-form writing and website
