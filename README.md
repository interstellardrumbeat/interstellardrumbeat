## Domenico Prudenzano 👋

**Scientific & Technical Writer | PhD in Physics**

I’m a **scientific and technical writer with a background Physics (PhD) and in Chemistry (Bachelor and Master's degrees)**. I like to work at the intersection of **technology, research, and documentation** and also enjoy creating science- and tech-related content for general audiences. My focus is on turning complex topics into clear, usable, and well-structured material.

This GitHub profile serves as a **portfolio hub** and contains:
- 📘 Technical writing samples
- 📄 Academic / scientific writing
- 🐍 Small Python projects
- 🌐 Links to my longer-form writing and website

## 👀 How to Read my GitHub profile

If you’re reviewing this profile as a recruiter, here’s a quick guide to navigating it:
- **If you’re hiring for a Technical Writer role** → start with [`tech-writing/`](https://github.com/interstellardrumbeat/tech-writing). Examples of documentation aimed at developer tools, scientific software, and technical products. These samples focus on clarity, structure, and user-centered writing.
- **If you’re hiring for a Scientific / Research Writer role** → see [`academic-writing/`](https://github.com/interstellardrumbeat/academic-writing). This section contains formal scientific writing, peer-reviewed papers, and long-form research communication (all in one file, my PhD thesis).
- **If you’re assessing technical fluency or scripting ability** → check [`python-projects/`](https://github.com/interstellardrumbeat/python-projects). These are small, well-documented projects meant to show practical Python usage.
- **For broader context** (writing style, general communication skills, content creation and published articles) → see the [links](#-external-links--contacts) to my Medium profile and website.
